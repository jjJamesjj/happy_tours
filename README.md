Project for MAT8480 Data Mining and Predictive Analysis class, based on R.
We will analyze 3 years of sales reports from a traveling company, comprised of many different information of customers and aspects of the trips, to predict whether such customers will book another trip within 12 months from their last one or not.
The project will utilize our knowledge and techniques of data models and model-based predictive analysis.
